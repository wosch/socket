This is release 1.1 of the Socket(1) program.

Socket(1) implements an interface to TCP sockets at shell level.
Client and server sockets can be used from shell scripts or
interactively.  Socket can also run a program with stdin, stdout, and
stderr connected to the socket connection.  Sample shell scripts
implementing a finger client (remote only) and a finger daemon are
included.
