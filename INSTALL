Socket-1.1 runs on these platforms:

  - AT 386, ISC 3.0			(*)
  - CDC 4680, EP/IX 1.4.1.		(*)
  - DECstation 3100, Ultrix 4.0
  - HP-UX 7.0, 8.0			(*)
  - IBM RS 6000, AIX 3.1.5
  - MicroVAX II, 4.3 BSD		(*)
  - SGI Iris, Irix 3.3.1
  - Sequent, DYNIX v.3.0.7		(*)
  - Sun SPARCstation II, SunOS 4.1.2
  - System V Rel. 4			(*)

The platforms marked with "(*)" require minor editing of the Makefile.
Instructions are included near the beginning of the Makefile. Edit as
necessary and type "make install". This builds the program and
installs the executable as /usr/local/bin/socket and the manual page
as /usr/local/man/man1/socket.1.

Socket relies on some Berkeleyisms in signal, process, and IO
handling, so porting it to (other) non-BSD-derived platforms may be
difficult.  I am interested in any changes you make to port the
program to a new platform.  Please send them back to me so I can merge
them into a later release.

The Makefile is not suitable for development since it doesn't include
the dependencies. (I use the Shape Toolkit for development.)
To correct this, include the file Dependencies into the Makefile.
